# Using OSVR
## Getting Started
- [HDK Unboxing and Getting Started](Getting-Started/HDK/HDK-Unboxing-and-Getting-Started.md)
- [HDK Unboxing and Getting Started (SPANISH)](Getting-Started/HDK/HDK-Unboxing-and-Getting-Started-ES.md)

## Installing OSVR

- [Windows](Getting-Started/Installing/windows.md)
  - Minimum recommended version : Windows Vista SP1 or later
  - [Download pre-compiled binaries and drivers](http://osvr.github.io/using/)
  - [Install and test RenderManager](Installing/RenderManager.md)
- [Linux](Getting-Started/Installing/Linux-Build-Instructions.md)
  - Minimum recommended version : Debian Jessie or equivalent ( Ubuntu 15.04+ for example )
  - [Very generic instructions](Getting-Started/Installing/linux.md)
- [Android](https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Android-Build#readme)
- [OS X](Getting-Started/Installing/osx.md)
  - Minimum recommended version : El Capitan

Note : It can be used in earlier versions but might require compilation and tweaking.

## Running the OSVR Server
### Setting the OSVR_SERVER_ROOT environment variable
OSVR server auto-start functionality in ClientKit (Windows only for now) currently relies on the OSVR_SERVER_ROOT environment variable to find the server you would like to have launch. Install the [OSVR Runtime](http://osvr.github.io/using/), then set the OSVR_SERVER_ROOT environment variable to C:/Program Files/OSVR/Runtime/Server (for 64-bit) or C:/Program Files (x86)/OSVR/Runtime/Server (for 32-bit).

### Server parameters
Running the OSVR server just requires passing it a configuration file. For example:
**osvr_server osvr_server_config.json**

if no parameter is specified, a default file is used.

# Useful Links 
### Contributed from the OSVR community

- Revive allows non Oculus headsets be used for games which only support Oculus headsets when run through steamvr runtime https://github.com/LibreVR/Revive and then potentially work on OSVR supported through the SteamVR interface
- FakeVive allows non HTC headsets be used for games which only support HTC headsets when run through steamvr runtime. https://github.com/Shockfire/FakeVive
- Non-Vive controllers can be used through with OSVR with Vive games. See https://github.com/OSVR/OSVR-Docs/blob/master/Extending-OSVR/ConfiguringHDKViveTracking.md . Alternatively, OpenVR-AdvancedSettings gives users access to many useful openvr and openvr apps settings. Users that do not have Vive controllers will need to access these settings from desktop or rely on using the hydra drivers and six sense SDK from steam tools to emulate Vive controllers to access the settings in an overlay running as a steamvr dashboard app https://github.com/matzman666/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings
